First guess was
Part 1, Total Exposed Sides: 4322

4070 is too high
2487 is not the right answer
2438 is not the right answer; edge blocks I can see - touches to enclosed block
2235 is too low

Edge Blocks Found: 1104
Sides to remove because edge block touches enclosed: 49
Enclosed gaps:  42
Total edge piece sides: 2487
Ajusted Surface Area: 2438
